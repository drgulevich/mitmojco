# MiTMoJCo version 1.2

MiTMoJCo (Microscopic Tunneling Model for Josephson Contacts) 
represents a C library and collection of Python tools designed to assist modeling superconducting Josephson junctions within the formalism of microscopic tunneling theory. The purpose of the C code is to offer implementation of a computationally demanding part of this calculation which is evaluation of the superconducting pair and quasiparticle tunnel currents. 
The tunnel currents calculated by MiTMoJCo are offered to user's disposal to be employed in a specialized ODE/PDE solver or within a finite difference or finite element scheme in a custom C code.
The source code contains a collection of Python tools to work with tunnel current amplitudes which characterize specific superconducting materials constituting a tunnel junction and 
examples of modeling some common cases of Josephson contacts.

**Installation**

    $ git clone https://github.com/drgulevich/mitmojco

Modify CMakeLists.txt to suit your needs. Default installation paths are set in CMakeLists.txt to
    /usr/local/lib for the shared library and /usr/local/include/mitmojco for the headers.

In the mitmojco directory create and enter the build/ folder. Then execute cmake, make and the installation procedure: 

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

Check the installation by running one of the provided examples. 

**Examples**

The source code contains 6 examples of modeling common cases of Josephson contacts:

1. Current-biased SIS junction.

2. Voltage-biased SIS junction under ac drive.

3. Sine-Gordon breather in long Josephson junction.

4. Fluxon in an Annular Josephson junction.

5. Flux Flow Oscillator.

6. deal.II+MiTMoJCo: 2D model of Josephson junction.

To compile the first example type from the `examples/` folder

    $ make example-1

Use similar command to compile examples 1-5. The last example 6 requires `deal.II` finite element library (https://www.dealii.org/).
